## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Production code changes | Mockups only — code changes in a separate milestone after approval |
| iOS app mockups | Already have v3 prototype (ui_concept_4_driver_app_v3.html) |
| Dealer portal mockups | Lower priority, separate user base |
| Interactive functionality | Mockups show layout/styling, not working features |
| Mobile responsive mockups | Focus on desktop dispatch workflow first |
