## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (cumulative across milestones).

Recent decisions affecting v1.2:
- v1.1 milestone: Approved mockup design system with shared.css (1,308 lines)
- Production sidebar nav order confirmed (differs from mockup, use production order)
- design-system.css started with tokens and bridge aliases, some hex replacements done

### Known Issues
- Production index.html is ~38K lines — changes must be carefully targeted per renderXxx() function
- Work already started on design-system.css — partial tokens and bridge aliases exist
- Some hex→var() replacements already done in index.html — audit needed to avoid duplicate work

### Pending Todos
- (None yet)

### Blockers/Concerns
- None yet
