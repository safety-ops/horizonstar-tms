<objective>
Create the Compliance Hub mockup — a single HTML page with all 7 sub-tabs: Dashboard, Compliance Tasks, Driver Files, Truck Files, Company Files, Tickets/Violations, and Accident Registry. This is the most complex page in this plan set, requiring tab switching, list+detail views, and realistic regulatory data.

Purpose: The Compliance hub is the central location for all regulatory, documentation, and safety tracking. It spans driver qualification files, truck compliance, company filings, violations, and accident records. The mockup must show the full depth of compliance management.

Output: `mockups/web-tms-redesign/compliance.html` — standalone HTML file with all 7 tabs and JavaScript tab switching.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create compliance.html with all 7 sub-tabs</name>
  <files>mockups/web-tms-redesign/compliance.html</files>
  <action>
Create `compliance.html` by copying the app shell from `base-template.html`. Set title to "Horizon Star TMS — Compliance" and mark the Compliance nav item as `active`.

Inside `<div class="page-content">`, build the complete compliance hub with JavaScript tab switching across 7 sub-tabs. Default to Dashboard tab active.

**Reference production structure (lines 21721-22120 of index.html) for layout fidelity.**

**CRITICAL from user decisions:**
- Dashboard hero card MUST use design system green gradient tokens: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(34,197,94,0.12) 0%, rgba(34,197,94,0.04) 100%); border: 2px solid var(--green);` — NOT the hardcoded `linear-gradient(135deg, #1e40af, #3b82f6)` from production
- All 7 sub-tabs must have FULL content with realistic data — no stubs or placeholders
- Compliance Tasks must use actual real-world task names (BOC-3, MCS-150, UCR, IFTA, IRP, 2290 Heavy Vehicle Tax, Drug & Alcohol Consortium, etc.)
