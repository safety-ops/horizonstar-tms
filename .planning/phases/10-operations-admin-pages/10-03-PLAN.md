<objective>
Create Maintenance Records and Tasks mockup pages — two simpler table/card-based pages. Maintenance shows fleet maintenance records with filtering and cost tracking. Tasks shows the task management board with priority-based visual treatment.

Purpose: Maintenance tracks all fleet repair and service history. Tasks provides operational task management with urgency-based visual hierarchy (red for overdue, amber for urgent).

Output: `mockups/web-tms-redesign/maintenance.html` and `mockups/web-tms-redesign/tasks.html` — two standalone HTML files.

- Type badge colors match the category meaning (repair = red = urgent, preventive = amber = scheduled, inspection = blue = routine, upgrade = green = improvement)
- Cost column: monospace, text-align right
- Simple, clean layout — this is one of the simpler TMS pages
