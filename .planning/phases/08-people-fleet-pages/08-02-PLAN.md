<objective>
Create the Local Drivers mockup page with the list view (year selector, stats, local drivers table, pending pickup table, pending delivery table with full-row status colors) and the local driver detail view (stats, driver info, assigned orders table) in a single HTML file.

Purpose: Local Drivers is the most complex table page with 14-15 column tables and a unique 5-state row color system. The mockup must demonstrate the status cycling pattern, full-row background tinting, and all 5 confirmation states.

Output: `mockups/web-tms-redesign/local-drivers.html` — standalone HTML file with list and detail views.

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (from user decisions):**
- Current year (2026) realistic data
- Row colors preserved for all 5 status states
- All 14-15 columns visible with horizontal scroll

**Styling notes:**
- Pending tables MUST use full-row background tinting via inline `style="background: rgba(...);"` on `<tr>` elements. Use the design-system-compatible RGBA values (not production hex colors).
- Status icons in pending tables: Use emoji circles with appropriate colors.
- Phone numbers: style as clickable links (`color: var(--blue); cursor: pointer;`).
- Money values: green color, monospace font.
- Keep page-specific CSS under 80 lines.
- Actions column should be sticky on tables wider than viewport.
