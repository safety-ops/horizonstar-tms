<objective>
Create the Dispatchers mockup page with a simple table (Code, Name, Cars Booked, Revenue Generated, Actions).

Purpose: Dispatchers is the simplest page in this phase -- just a header and table. The mockup must match production simplicity exactly (no rankings, no cards, no enhancements). This is a quick plan.

Output: `mockups/web-tms-redesign/dispatchers.html` — standalone HTML file with dispatchers table.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create dispatchers.html with simple table</name>
  <files>mockups/web-tms-redesign/dispatchers.html</files>
  <action>
Create `dispatchers.html` by copying the app shell from `base-template.html`. Set title to "Horizon Star TMS -- Dispatchers" and mark the Dispatchers nav item as `active` (if present in sidebar; if not, add a nav item under the appropriate section).

Inside `<div class="page-content">`, build the dispatchers page.

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT (from user decisions):**
- Keep it minimal. Simple table with Code, Name, Cars Booked, Revenue, Edit/Delete. Match production simplicity, no enhancement.

---

**1. Header Row**
- Title: "Dispatchers" (no emoji in production -- match that)
- "+ New Dispatcher" button (btn-primary)

**2. Dispatchers Table**
- `.table-container` with `.table`
- Columns: Code | Name | Cars Booked | Revenue Generated | Actions
- 5 rows with realistic data:

Row 1:
  - Code: "DSP-01" (bold)
  - Name: "Sarah Johnson"
  - Cars Booked: "47"
  - Revenue: "$87,450.00" (green mono, `.money.positive` style)
  - Actions: Edit (btn-ghost btn-sm) | Del (btn-ghost btn-sm text-danger)

Row 2:
  - Code: "DSP-02" (bold)
  - Name: "Mike Rodriguez"
  - Cars Booked: "38"
  - Revenue: "$72,320.00"
  - Actions: Edit | Del

Row 3:
  - Code: "DSP-03" (bold)
  - Name: "Lisa Wang"
  - Cars Booked: "52"
  - Revenue: "$94,180.00"
  - Actions: Edit | Del

Row 4:
  - Code: "DSP-04" (bold)
  - Name: "James Brown"
  - Cars Booked: "29"
  - Revenue: "$51,640.00"
  - Actions: Edit | Del

Row 5:
  - Code: "DSP-05" (bold)
  - Name: "Ana Petrova"
  - Cars Booked: "33"
  - Revenue: "$62,890.00"
  - Actions: Edit | Del

**Styling notes:**
- This is the SIMPLEST page in the phase -- no page-specific CSS needed beyond shared.css.
- Revenue column: `font-family: var(--font-mono); color: var(--green); font-weight: var(--weight-semibold);`
- Code column: `font-weight: var(--weight-bold);`
- No cards, no stat cards, no rankings, no badges, no gradients.
- Just header + table. That's it.
